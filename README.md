# MobiCom 2024 Pre-Workshop


ACM MobiCom is the flagship conference sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE to address  challenges in the areas of mobile computing and wireless/mobile networking. We organize this MobiCom Pre-Workshop to bring together researchers mainly in China to present and share their research accepted at MobiCom '24. This one-day workshop also aims to serve as a venue to gather researchers in the community to brainstorm research ideas and shape future research directions.  
This workshop is free for registration. Complimentary lunch and snacks will be provided. The participants are responsible for their own travel and accommodation arrangements. This workshop is open to everyone and priority is given to presenters. As space is limited, we encourage early registration and adopt the first come and first serve policy.
